# dotfiles

super lazy dotfiles repo

# Install

clone this repo in your home folder:

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/argshook/argsdotfiles.git
```

# How does it work

this repo contains `.gitignore` which ignores everything except for some dotfiles. That's it.

# Why not symlinks?

i don't know, maybe later

i might or might not write some uninstall script for this.
